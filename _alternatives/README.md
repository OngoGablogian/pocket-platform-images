# Alternative (or old) Overrides

These are overrides that were either used before or made as an alternative to what I have in my main release.  These overrides will not be included in the release and must be downloaded manually.

- Some of these are for cores that started as single games, but became a multi-game core.
- Others are images for custom cores

* TMNT Combines both TMNT and Simpsons into a Single core, but the video resolutions don't match, so it's not perfect :(
* Block Block is a custom core that copies JTpang to play Block Block. BB works on the normal JTpang core now, so it's not necessary.


## Previous Version of Arcade Core Images

Starting with Release 5.0, I remade and touched up almost all of my arcade images. Rather than simply gray-scaling the arcade marquee, I'm making a new image by using the original arcade artwork.

You can still use the old images, if you'd like. :)

All the image are collected in the following zip files for easy download: <a href="pocket-platform-overrides-arcade-v4_archived.zip">pocket-platform-overrides-arcade-v4_archived.zip</a>

## Previous Version of Home Core Images

Starting with Release v3.0, I changed the style of my home imagery. These were all the images I used to use. Also included are images in the same style for unreleased cores that I made in preparation.

You can still use them if you'd like. :)

All of these images are collected in the following zip file for easy download: <a href="pocket-platform-overrides-home-v2_archived.zip">pocket-platform-overrides-home-v2_archived.zip</a>
