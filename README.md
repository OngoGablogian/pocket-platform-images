# Platform Overrides for the Analogue Pocket

This repository contains image and JSON overrides I've used for various cores on the Analogue Pocket. You can use them, too, if you'd like. Simply download a release, or the entire repository and copy the contents of the Platforms folder into your own Platform folder. Or, pick and choose what you'd like to use. :)

Also included are the PNG images I used to create the BIN files. You can take a look at these to determine whether or not you want to use these images.

Note: There are also folders for alternate overrides and overrides for cores that haven't been released yet. I've put those into separate folders that are not included in releases.  As unreleased cores become released, I'll move them into releases. If you'd like to get them now, download the whole repository and grab them that way. :)

Advisory: Putting too many* JSON files in the Platforms folder will caused some problems displaying cores in the openFPGA menu on the Pocket. It's recommended to only use JSON files for cores you have installed.

Enjoy!

Thanks to mattpannella for release details, and terminator2k2 for the repo folder structure.


*too many = I don't know the real limit. At one point, I had 310 json in the directory and that was too many. I've also had 100 json in the directory, and that was okay. The limit is probably above 200.
