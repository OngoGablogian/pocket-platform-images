# Platform Images for the Analogue Pocket

This repository contains images I've used for various cores on the Analogue Pocket. You can use them, too, if you'd like. Simply download a release, or the entire repository and copy the contents of the Platforms folder into your own Platform folder.

Also included are the PNG images I used to create the BIN files. You can take a look at these to determine whether or not you want to use these images.

Enjoy!

Thanks to mattpannella for release details, and terminator2k2 for the folder structure.
