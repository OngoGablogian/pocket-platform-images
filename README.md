# Platform Images for the Analogue Pocket

This repository contains images I've used for various cores on the Analogue Pocket. You can use them, too, if you'd like. Simply download the repository and copy the contents of the Platforms folder into your own Platform folder.

Also including are the PNG image I used to create the BIN files. You can take a look at these to determine whether or not you want to use my images.

Enjoy!
