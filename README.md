# Platform Overrides for the Analogue Pocket

This repository contains image and JSON overrides I've used for various cores on the Analogue Pocket. You can use them, too, if you'd like. Simply download a release, or the entire repository and copy the contents of the Platforms folder into your own Platform folder. Or, pick and choose what you'd like to use. :)

Also included are the PNG images I used to create the BIN files. You can take a look at these to determine whether or not you want to use these images.

Enjoy!

Thanks to mattpannella for release details, and terminator2k2 for the folder structure.
